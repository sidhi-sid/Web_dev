Typescript

1.Types
let astring: string;
let anumber:number;
let aboolean:boolean;
let anarray:Array<string>;
let anything:any;

If type is not defined while declaring but is initialized with some value then type of value is used for that variable.

2.Classes
//private properties can only be accessed from within the class
class Car{
    gears:number;  //public by default
    private speed:number;
    constructor(speed:number){
        this.speed=speed||0;
    }
    accelerate():void{
        this.speed++;  
    }
    getSpeed():void{ //way to use private property
        console.log(this.speed); 
    }
    static numberWheels():number{ //it does not depend from which object it is called as it is static
        return 4; 
    }
}
//create an object from a class
let car=new Car(5);
car.accelerate();
car.getSpeed();
console.log(Car.numberWheels);
